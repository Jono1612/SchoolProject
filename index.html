    </h2>
    <p>
        The game is a simple easy going clicker game where everything about the button changes when you click on it. It is all for fun although it could be used in a competitive way because of the scoreboard. There is no issue in any country with this game because it's simple and very easy to play with no connections to anything but perhaps a magic button. Enjoy this game and have fun.
    My highscore is 2121
